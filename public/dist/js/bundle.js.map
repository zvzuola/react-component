For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n    if (a === b) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !isIterable(b) ||\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n    ) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n      var entries = a.entries();\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n      }) && entries.next().done;\n    }\n\n    var flipped = false;\n\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n          a.cacheResult();\n        }\n      } else {\n        flipped = true;\n        var _ = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = _;\n      }\n    }\n\n    var allEqual = true;\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n        allEqual = false;\n        return false;\n      }\n    });\n\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n  }\n\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\n      }\n      this._value = value;\n      this.size = times === undefined ?

Wraps a single child without adding\nadditional DOM nodes.\n\nThe API attempts to be as declarative as possible. A single animation property declares what\nanimation the child should have. If that property changes, this component applies the new animation\nto the child on the next tick.\n\nBy default, the animation is not run when the component is mounted. Instead, Velocity's \"finish\"\ncommand is used to jump to the animation's end state. For a component that animates out of and\nback in to a default state, this allows the parent to specify the \"animate into\" animation as\nthe default, and therefore not have to distinguish between the initial state and the state to\nreturn to after animating away.\n\nProperties:\n animation: Either an animation key or hash defining the animation. See Velocity's documentation\n   for what this can be. (It is passed to Velocity exactly.)\n runOnMount: If true, runs the animation even when the component is first mounted.\n targetQuerySelector: By default, this component's single child is animated. If targetQuerySelector\n   is provided, it is used to select descendants to apply the animation to. Use with caution, only\n   when you're confident that React's reconciliation will preserve these nodes during animation.\n   Also note querySelectorAll's silly behavior w.r.t. pruning results when being called on a node.\n   A special value of \"children\" will use the direct children of the node, since there isn't a\n   great way to specify that to querySelectorAll.\n interruptBehavior: Sets how the previous animation should behave when the \"animation\" prop is\n   changed before it’s done. Default is \"stop\", which halts the animation where it is. \"finish\"\n   will jump the animation to its completed appearance. \"queue\" will run the new animation after\n   the previous one has finished.\n\nUnrecognized properties are passed as options to Velocity (e.g. \"duration\", \"delay\", \"loop\").\n\nMethods:\n runAnimation: Triggers the animation immediately. Useful for when you want an animation that\n   corresponds to an event but not a particular model state change (e.g. a \"bump\" when a click\n   occurs).\n*/\n\nvar _ = {\n  forEach: require('lodash/collection/forEach'),\n  isEqual: require('lodash/lang/isEqual'),\n  keys: require('lodash/object/keys'),\n  omit: require('lodash/object/omit')\n};\n\nvar React = require('react');\nvar ReactDOM = require('react-dom');\nvar PropTypes = require('prop-types');\nvar Velocity = require('./lib/velocity-animate-shim');\n\nvar VelocityComponent = function (_React$Component) {\n  _inherits(VelocityComponent, _React$Component);\n\n  function VelocityComponent(props) {\n    _classCallCheck(this, VelocityComponent);\n\n    var _this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, (VelocityComponent.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(VelocityComponent)).call(this, props));\n\n    _this._animationTimeout = null;\n\n    // This public method is kept as self-bound to maintain compatibility with the React.createClass\n    // version of the component.\n    _this.runAnimation = _this.runAnimation.bind(_this);\n    return _this;\n  }\n\n  _createClass(VelocityComponent, [{\n    key: 'componentDidMount',\n    value: function componentDidMount() {\n      this.runAnimation();\n\n      // Jump to the end so that the component has the visual appearance of the animation having\n      // been run to completion.\n      if (this.props.runOnMount !== true) {\n        this._finishAnimation();\n      }\n    }\n  }, {\n    key: 'componentWillUpdate',\n    value: function componentWillUpdate(newProps, newState) {\n      if (!_.isEqual(newProps.animation, this.props.animation)) {\n        if (newProps.interruptBehavior === 'stop') {\n          this._stopAnimation();\n        } else if (newProps.interruptBehavior === 'finish') {\n          this._finishAnimation();\n        }\n\n        this._scheduleAnimation();\n      }\n    }\n  }, {\n    key: 'componentWillUnmount',\n    value: function componentWillUnmount() {\n      this._stopAnimation();\n      this._clearVelocityCache(this._getDOMTarget());\n\n      if (this._animationTimeout) {\n        clearTimeout(this._animationTimeout);\n      }\n    }\n\n    // It's ok to call this externally!

Delegates to the React TransitionGroup\naddon.\n\nProperties\n  enter: Animation to run on a child component being added\n  leave: Animation to run on a child component leaving\n  runOnMount: if true, runs the \"enter\" animation on the elements that exist as children when this\n    component is mounted.\n  enterHideStyle/enterShowStyle: see below.\n\nAny additional properties (e.g. \"className\", \"component\") will be passed to the internal\nTransitionGroup.\n\n\"enter\" and \"leave\" should either be a string naming an animation, or a hash with an\n\"animation\" key that can either be a string itself, or a hash of style attributes to animate (this\nvalue is passed to Velocity its the first arg).\n\nIf \"enter\" or \"leave\" is a hash, it can additionally have a \"style\" value that is applied the tick\nbefore the Velocity animation starts. Use this for non-animating properties (like \"position\") that\nare prerequisites for correct animation. The style value is applied using Velocity's JS -> CSS\nroutines, which may differ from React's.\n\nAny hash entries beyond \"animation\" and \"style\" are passed in an options hash to Velocity. Use this\nfor options like \"stagger\", \"reverse\", &tc.\n\nBy default, this component will immediately hide all entering children with display: 'none', and\nunhide them one tick later with display: ''. This is done so that we can coalesce multiple enters\ninto a single animation, and we want to avoid any popping of elements in while they're collected. If\nyou prefer a different way of hiding these elements so that e.g. geometry can be immediately\ncalculated, use the enterHideStyle and enterShowStyle props to provide alternate style hashes for\nhiding and revealing entering elements.\n\nStatics\n  disabledForTest: Set this to true globally to turn off all custom animation logic. Instead, this\n    component will behave like a vanilla TransitionGroup.\n\nInspired by https://gist.github.com/tkafka/0d94c6ec94297bb67091\n*/\n\nvar _ = {\n  each: require('lodash/collection/each'),\n  extend: require('lodash/object/extend'),\n  forEach: require('lodash/collection/forEach'),\n  isEqual: require('lodash/lang/isEqual'),\n  keys: require('lodash/object/keys'),\n  omit: require('lodash/object/omit'),\n  pluck: require('lodash/collection/pluck')\n};\nvar React = require('react');\nvar ReactDOM = require('react-dom');\nvar PropTypes = require('prop-types');\nvar TransitionGroup = require('react-transition-group/TransitionGroup');\nvar Velocity = require('./lib/velocity-animate-shim');\n\n// Shim requestAnimationFrame for browsers that don't support it, in particular IE 9.\nvar shimRequestAnimationFrame = typeof window !== 'undefined' && (window.requestAnimationFrame || window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame || window.mozRequestAnimationFrame || function (callback) {\n  window.setTimeout(callback, 0);\n});\n\n// Fix 'Invalid calling object' error in IE\nshimRequestAnimationFrame = typeof window !== 'undefined' && shimRequestAnimationFrame.bind(window);\n\nvar shimCancelAnimationFrame = typeof window !== 'undefined' && (window.cancelAnimationFrame || window.webkitCancelAnimationFrame || window.mozCancelAnimationFrame || function (timeout) {\n  window.clearTimeout(timeout);\n});\n\nshimCancelAnimationFrame = typeof window !== 'undefined' && shimCancelAnimationFrame.bind(window);\n\n// Internal wrapper for the transitioned elements.
